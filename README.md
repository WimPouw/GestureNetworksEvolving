# Updates
- In 2024 the code was kindly checked for reproducibility by researcher Elen Le Foll (Osnabr√ºck University) using R version 4.0.2. Due to her quality checks, the github has undergone a few corrections, including some lines of code not running because of caching issues and added some missing libraries (and adding a missing reference). The new code should thus still be fully functional in 2024.

- # Post-publication acknowledgements
